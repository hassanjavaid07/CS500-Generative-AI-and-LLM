With profound sadness and deep respect, we had to bid 
farewell to Shahab Ghauri, our esteemed Ex-Chairman 
and Founder, who passed away in April this year after 
a prolonged illness. He was not only an entrepreneur 
and philanthropist, but also a visionary whose influence
has profoundly shaped both our company and society. 
His journey with NETSOL went beyond mere work; it 
was fueled by passion, innovation and an unwavering 
commitment to excellence.
Throughout his distinguished career, Shahab Ghauri 
led numerous groundbreaking initiatives that elevated
NETSOL to new heights. His forward-thinking 
approach, from driving technological advancements 
to establishing strategic partnerships, transformed 
obstacles into opportunities and was pivotal to our 
success.
Shahab Ghauri was not only the visionary behind
NETSOL, but also a guiding force whose influence 
extended far beyond the walls of our organization. His 
legacy is woven into the very fabric of our company and 
his impact will be felt for generations to come. Under 
his leadership, NETSOL grew from a small startup
into a global leader and this remarkable journey is a 
reflection of his relentless pursuit of greatness.
Shahab Ghauri’s impact reached far beyond the 
confines of the boardroom. He was a staunch advocate 
for corporate social responsibility, dedicating himself
to causes that supported the underprivileged and 
empowered communities. Through his support for 
educational programs, healthcare initiatives and 
environmental sustainability projects, Shahab Ghauri’s 
philanthropic efforts made a significant difference in
many lives and motivated others to contribute.
His journey was not just one of professional success, 
but of personal perseverance and courage. Despite 
facing a prolonged illness, Shahab Ghauri continued 
to inspire us all with his strength and determination.
His ability to remain steadfast in his vision and 
his dedication to the company, even in the face of 
adversity, was nothing short of extraordinary. He 
was a beacon of resilience, demonstrating that true 
leadership is not just about steering the ship, but about
weathering the storms with grace and fortitude.
Shahab Ghauri was a man of remarkable intellect and 
insight. His innovative ideas and strategic thinking 
were the cornerstones of our success. He had an innate 
ability to see opportunities where others saw obstacles
and to turn challenges into triumphs. His leadership 
style was characterized by a rare combination of 
humility and authority. He believed in empowering the 
NETSOL team, encouraging creativity and fostering 
an environment where everyone felt valued and
motivated. It was this approach that cultivated a 
culture of collaboration and excellence at NETSOL. 
Beyond his professional achievements, he was known 
for his generosity and kindness. He had a genuine 
interest in the well-being of those around him and was
always willing to lend a helping hand. His mentorship 
and support have shaped countless careers and 
touched many lives. Colleagues and employees alike 
will remember him not just for his achievements, but 
for the way he made each person feel important and 
valued.
As we continue to grapple with his loss, let us 
remember Shahab Ghauri with gratitude for the honor 
of having known him. Although he is no longer with 
us in person, his spirit remains an integral part of the 
NETSOL family. We honor his memory by upholding his
values, embodying his vision and continuing his legacy 
of excellence and compassion.
In honoring his memory, we are committed to carrying 
forward the principles he cherished and the standards 
he set. The company will continue to build upon the
foundation he laid, striving for excellence, embracing 
innovation and upholding the values he instilled in us. 
His vision and passion will remain a guiding light as we 
navigate the future and his spirit will continue to inspire 
us in all that we do.
While his journey in this life may have ended, his legacy 
will forever endure. His spirit will guide us as we move 
forward and his memory will be a constant reminder 
of the greatness that can be achieved through vision, 
perseverance and a genuine commitment to making 
the world a better place.
Thank you for everything you have given us and for 
leaving a mark on our hearts and our company that will 
never fade.
The company will continue to 
build upon the foundation he laid, 
striving for excellence, embracing 
innovation and upholding the 
values he instilled in us.

As we reflect on the past financial year, I am both proud 
and invigorated by the strides our company has made. 
This period has been transformative for us, marked by 
significant achievements, challenges overcome and a 
reaffirmation of our commitment to delivering exceptional
value to our clients and partners worldwide. 
Our commitment to flexibility and customization is 
demonstrated through all our product offerings and 
their ability to handle complex multi-country and multi-
jurisdictional requirements. Whether it’s our core finance
and leasing platform Ascent, our API-first products or 
our digital retail and mobility solutions, our technology is 
designed to support diverse business environments and 
adapt to evolving needs. We also continue to offer a range 
of professional services as well as cloud solutions and
services in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
Otoz, our fully digital, white-label platform for digital auto 
retail and mobility orchestration, was built in our Lahore, 
Pakistan office via our Unity R&D lab. The product has 
witnessed great success in the United States, with some
customers that have already signed up for and are utilizing 
our Otoz platform. Following this, subsequently, we foresee 
more interest generated for this product in the North 
American region. We will continue to develop the roadmap 
for Otoz – for which the potential is vast as we continue to
witness traction and anticipate interest via further client 
engagements in the coming years. 
We also foresee continued interest in our suite of API-
first, SaaS-based products – Appex Now. These products 
were developed specifically for the global credit, finance
and leasing industry. Their availability through flexible, 
subscription-based pricing and lightning-fast onboarding 
has already resulted in these products being signed up for, 
and subsequently deployed by various financial institutions 
in the United Kingdom.
This year, our company had undertaken a strategic 
restructuring to enhance operational efficiency and reduce 
costs. By reducing the size of our workforce, we have 
achieved significant cost savings without any disruption 
to our operations. This adjustment has allowed us to
maintain our commitment to delivering exceptional value 
and performance, and maintaining our position as a leading 
technology solutions provider primarily to the global asset 
finance and leasing industry. 
Despite the reduction in staff, we have ensured that
we have retained our best performing employees, who 
continue to be well-supported both financially and non-
financially. We have implemented measures to enhance 
their job satisfaction, provide robust benefits and offer 
career development opportunities. Our goal is to foster a
positive work environment where our global team feels 
valued and motivated.
Our focus remains on sustaining high operational standards 
while nurturing our talented workforce. We believe this 
approach will drive long-term success and maintain our
position as a leading force in the industry. At NETSOL, we 
are deeply committed to the continuous development 
of our employees. We recognize that investing in our 
team’s growth is crucial for both their personal career 
advancement and our overall success.
To this end, we continue to offer comprehensive training 
programs designed to enhance skillsets and keep our 
staff at the forefront of industry trends and technologies. 
Through professional development and training, and by 
fostering a supportive and dynamic work environment, we
empower our employees to deliver exceptional results and 
contribute to our ongoing success.
Our company has embarked on a journey to establish itself 
as a center of excellence in AI through Project Optimus. 
Our dedicated team of AI architects, data scientists and
engineers are singularly focused on developing cutting-
edge AI solutions. Project Optimus is designed to enhance 
our internal software development processes, making 
them more efficient and effective. By harnessing advanced 
AI technologies, we aim to drive innovation and optimize
our existing offerings. This strategic focus on AI not only 
promises to elevate our internal capabilities, but also 
ensures that we continue to deliver top-tier solutions that 
meet the evolving needs of our clients.
NETSOL is poised to be recognized as a leader in AI
initiatives by proactively setting the standard rather than 
following market trends. Over the past two years, we have 
diligently built a solid foundation in AI and ML, focusing 
on creating a strong infrastructure that benefits our 
organization at a fundamental level. We have concentrated
on developing and integrating AI solutions that deliver 
genuine value and efficiency. Our strategic approach 
has already yielded several successful proof of concepts 
within the company, demonstrating our commitment to 
harnessing AI’s transformative potential.
As we continue to scale and refine our AI capabilities, we 
are also extending our expertise to clients embarking on

their own AI journeys. We are actively supporting them in 
embracing and adapting to AI technologies, positioning 
ourselves as thought leaders in the field. Our goal is 
to foster meaningful engagements with these clients, 
guiding them through the evolving landscape of AI and
its implications for their businesses. We anticipate that 
these efforts will translate into substantial revenue 
opportunities moving ahead. 
Innovation has been at the heart of our strategy this 
year. We have continued to invest heavily in R&D to
ensure that our technology remains at the cutting-edge. 
Our focus on AI-driven solutions has enabled us to offer 
powerful analytics, seamless integration capabilities and 
advanced automation features that are transforming how 
businesses operate.
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our 
clients, partners and stakeholders for their unwavering 
support and trust. Your confidence in our technology and 
our team has been a driving force behind our success.
At the heart of our success is our people. This year,
we have continued to cultivate a culture of excellence, 
innovation and collaboration. Our team’s dedication 
and expertise have been instrumental in driving our 
achievements and maintaining our position as an 
industry leader. I want to acknowledge the hard work and
dedication of our global workforce who are essentially 
the NETSOL family. Your commitment to excellence and 
innovation is the cornerstone of our achievements and a 
source of inspiration for us all. 
“By harnessing advanced AI 
technologies, we aim to drive innovation
and optimize our existing offerings. This 
strategic focus on AI not only promises 
to elevate our internal capabilities, but 
also ensures that we continue to deliver 
top-tier solutions that meet the evolving 
needs of our clients.”
As we conclude another successful year, I extend my
deepest gratitude to our board members for their 
unwavering support, insightful guidance and dedication. 
Your strategic vision and commitment have been 
instrumental in navigating our company through a 
dynamic landscape and achieving our goals. Your
collective expertise and leadership continue to drive 
our success and inspire excellence. Thank you for your 
invaluable contributions and for standing by us as we 
advance towards a promising future.
In closing, the fiscal year has been a period of remarkable
progress and success for our company. We have achieved 
significant milestones, expanded our offerings and 
continued to deliver exceptional value to our clients 
across the globe. As we look to the future, we are excited 
about the opportunities that lie ahead and are committed
to continuing our journey of growth and innovation.
Looking ahead, as we move into the next fiscal period, we 
remain focused on our strategic priorities and committed 
to driving further growth and innovation. Our roadmap 
includes expanding our technology offerings, enhancing
our global presence and continuing to deliver value to 
our clients through exceptional service and cutting-edge 
solutions.
We are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and 
confident in our ability to achieve our goals. This has been
a year of growth and our vision for the future is clear - to 
remain at the forefront of delivering unrivalled technology 
solutions.
It is with deep sorrow that I write about losing our 
Ex-Chairman Emeritus - Shahab Ghauri. As the original 
visionary and co-founder of NETSOL Technologies in
1995, Shahab’s contributions were instrumental in 
shaping the company’s direction for the decades to come. 
We will always remain indebted to him, his support as a 
seed investor and his unwavering belief in our mission. 
We will forever be grateful for his pioneering vision and
commitment. As we move forward, we remain dedicated 
to advancing his legacy and continuing the mission he so 
passionately began

Annual Report 2024
As we close another fiscal year, I am 
both proud and humbled to present 
our annual report, reflecting a year of 
significant achievements and strategic 
advancements at NETSOL Technologies. 
Serving as a trusted partner and 
technology provider primarily to the
global asset finance and leasing industry, 
our mission has always been to deliver 
transformative solutions that empower 
our clients to navigate an increasingly 
complex and dynamic landscape.
The financial services sector continues 
to undergo rapid evolution, driven by
technological advancements, regulatory 
changes and shifting market demands. 
At NETSOL, we have embraced these 
changes as opportunities to enhance our 
offerings and deliver value to our clients. 
This year, we have made remarkable 
strides in advancing our technology
solutions, expanding our market presence 
and deepening our relationships with key 
stakeholders.
We are thrilled to conclude the financial 
year 2023-2024 on a high note. The 
efforts invested throughout the past 
year are now yielding impressive results,
marked by significant top-line growth and 
an improved bottom line. This success can 
be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, 
a number of initiatives taken in the past 
few years, including the introduction of 
flexible, subscription-based pricing for our
solutions, have proven highly effective. 
This shift has delivered substantial 
positive outcomes, enhancing our ability 
to attain new customers. Secondly, 
our cost-cutting measures have also 
bought desired results. These measures 
involved not only reducing the size of
our workforce, but also meticulously 
evaluating and reducing costs across all 
areas of our business.
As we look ahead, NETSOL’s management 
is optimistic about the upcoming fiscal 
year 2024-2025. We anticipate new 
opportunities to further increase our 
22
NETSOL Technologies Limited
22
NETSOL Technologies Limited
revenue, driven by the addition of 
several new customers acquired 
during the past fiscal year, which will 
contribute to helping us bring in further 
new business. 
Throughout this fiscal year, we 
dedicated significant time, energy 
and focus to marketing our products
and services in the North American 
and European regions. We expect 
these efforts to continue delivering

current fiscal year.
The Company posted a net profit after tax of

Pakistani Rupee, the Company booked PKR 
326 million currency exchange loss during the 
period compared to an exchange gain of PKR

riod. This profitability has translated basic and

ing period. The Company posted net EBITDA

PRINCIPAL RISK AND UNERTAINTIES 
FACING THE COMPANY
Below are certain risk factors which may have
an impact on the future performance of the 
Company.
RISK FACTORS
A. STRATEGIC RISK 
In order to manage its strategic risks, NETSOL 
regularly identifies and keeps track of the 
latest trends in the dynamic and evolving 
global finance and leasing space. By working
on important technologies that have gained 
traction in the industry, NETSOL ensures that 
its clients remain a step ahead in the market 
and most importantly, have a futureproof 
business.
B. OPERATIONAL RISKS
The company carefully and constantly 
assesses and analyzes the market and the
global industry in which it operates. With 
Business Continuity Plans in place, the 
company continues to ensure zero disruption 
to its operations in the event of pandemics, 
natural disasters or other circumstances. 
The global NETSOL team continues to ensure
uninterrupted services to its clients across 
the world.
C. CYBER SECURITY THREATS
Given the significant impact of cybercrimes 
and their borderless, rapidly evolving nature, 
it is crucial for companies to implement 
stringent security measures to protect their
ICT infrastructure. NETSOL has established 
state-of-the-art security protocols to ensure 
the confidentiality, integrity and privacy of 
data belonging to the company, its clients, 
and employees. These measures include a 
robust intrusion prevention system, firewall,
encryption of data both at rest and in transit, 
restricted data access based on need-to-
know and least privilege principles, and the 
use of secure transmission protocols for 
communication.
NETSOL has successfully achieved SOC 2 
Type 1 and Type 2 compliance through a
global audit firm, conducted by A-LIGN, a 
trusted technology-enabled security and 
compliance partner serving over 2,500 global 
organizations. NETSOL’s achievement of SOC 
2 Type 2 compliance further underscores its 
commitment to safeguarding its client and
customer data. This accomplishment con-
firms that all system requirements have been 
met in accordance with the security standards 
set by the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants (AICPA), as defined by the 
applicable trust services criteria. The audit
of NETSOL’s suite of products and software 
services was conducted across its facilities in 
California, USA; London, England; Beijing, Chi-
na; Sydney, Australia; and Lahore, Pakistan.
D. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK
Foreign currency risk arises mainly where 
receivables and payables exist due to trans-
actions entered into foreign currencies. The 
Company is exposed to foreign currency risk 
on trade debts, some payables and revenues 
which are entered in a currency other than 
Pak Rupee. Majority of the revenue of the 
Company comes from contracts in currencies
other than Pak Rupees. The Company also 
holds cash and cash equivalents denominat-
ed in foreign currencies for working capital 
purposes.
E. LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk reflects an enterprise’s inability 
in raising funds to meet its commitments. The
Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises 
primarily from mismatch of the maturities of 
financial assets and liabilities. We however 
follow an effective cash management and 
planning policy to ensure ready availability of 
funds and to take appropriate actions for any 
new requirements.
F. INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value 
of future cash flows of a financial instrument 
will fluctuate because of changes in market 
interest rates. Majority of the interest rate 
exposure arises from short and long term 
borrowings from bank, term deposits and de-
posits in profit and loss/saving accounts with 
banks and investments in mutual funds.
MAIN TRENDS AND FACTORS LIKELY 
TO AFFECT THE FUTURE DEVELOP-
MENT, PERFORMANCE AND POSI-
TION OF THE COMPANY BUSINESS
The technology landscape is evolving rapidly 
and staying ahead requires a keen aware-
ness of emerging trends, market dynamics 
and external factors. As NETSOL reflects on 
the past year and looks ahead, it is crucial 
to understand the key trends and factors 
that will influence the future development, 
performance and position of the company’s 
business.
1. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS
AI and ML 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learn-
ing (ML) continue to be at the forefront of 
technological innovation. These technologies 
are driving transformative changes across 
various industries, including the financial
services and asset finance and leasing 
industry. AI and ML are enhancing data ana-
lytics, automating processes and improving 
decision-making capabilities. For NETSOL’s 
business, this means continuing to leverage 
AI to develop advanced solutions that can
predict market trends, optimize operations 
and offer personalized services to clients. 
Cloud computing 
Cloud computing remains a fundamental 
technology for modern businesses, providing 
scalability, flexibility and cost-efficiency. The 
shift towards hybrid and multi-cloud environ-
ments is growing, allowing organizations to 
leverage a mix of public and private clouds to 
meet their specific needs. NETSOL’s primary 
cloud partner Amazon Web Services (AWS) is 
the world’s leading, most comprehensive and 
broadly adopted cloud platform.
Cybersecurity
The rise in cyber threats and data breaches 
highlights the need for robust security meas-
ures. As a B2B technology company, ensuring 
the security of solutions and protecting client 
data is critical. NETSOL adheres to advanced, 
stringent cybersecurity measures, including
encryption, threat detection and response 
systems, to safeguard its operations and 
maintain trust with its clients worldwide. 
NETSOL solidified its commitment to data 
protection by achieving SOC 2 Type 2 compli-
ance in 2023. Previously, NETSOL had already
attained SOC 2 Type 1 compliance. By further 
55
Annual Report 2024
55
Annual Report 2024
attaining SOC 2 Type 2 compliance, the com-
pany continues to demonstrate its dedication 
to safeguarding the data of its clients and 
their customers. 
2. MARKET DYNAMICS
Economic conditions and market demand
Economic conditions play a significant role in
shaping business performance. Fluctuations 
in economic growth, inflation rates and poli-
cies can impact market demand for technol-
ogy solutions. As NETSOL navigates these 
uncertainties, it continues to remain agile and 
responsive to market changes. Understand-
ing emerging industry needs and adapting 
offerings accordingly will be key to sustaining 
growth and capturing new opportunities.
Regulatory changes
The regulatory environment for technology 
companies is continually evolving. Data pro-
tection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA,
have set new standards for data privacy and 
compliance. Additionally, regulations related 
to AI and technology ethics are gaining prom-
inence. Staying abreast of regulatory changes 
and ensuring compliance is essential for 
avoiding legal risks and maintaining a positive
reputation. NETSOL’s proactive approach to 
regulatory compliance includes regular audits, 
updates to its policies and engagement with 
regulatory bodies.
3. CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND PREFER-
ENCES
Personalization and customer experience
In today’s competitive landscape, delivering a
personalized customer experience is crucial. 
Businesses are increasingly focused on 
tailoring their solutions to meet the specific 
needs of their clients. NETSOL’s commitment 
to understanding customer preferences and 
delivering customized solutions drives its
success. By leveraging data analytics and AI, 
insights are attained pertaining to customer 
behavior, preferences and pain points, ena-
bling the company to offer targeted solutions 
and enhance customer satisfaction.
Demand for integrated solutions
As businesses seek to streamline their
operations, there is a growing demand for 
integrated technology solutions that offer 
seamless connectivity and interoperability. 
NETSOL’s ability to provide comprehensive, 
integrated solutions that address multiple 
business needs is a key differentiator. By
focusing on creating solutions that integrate 
with existing systems and provide a cohesive 
user experience, the company will continue to 
meet the evolving demands of its clients and 
strengthen its market position.
4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
Global competitors
NETSOL is facing competition from a number 
of players both on a regional and global 
level. There are a number of companies that 
provide technology solutions to the global 
asset finance and leasing industry as well as 
provide other services like those offered by
NETSOL. To maintain its competitive edge, 
the company must stay vigilant and adapt to 
changes in the competitive landscape. This 
includes monitoring industry trends, investing 
in research and development, and fostering 
strategic partnerships to enhance its capabili-
ties and market presence.
5. INNOVATION AND R&D
Investment in R&D 
Innovation is the driving force behind NET-
SOL’s global operations and business growth. 
Continuing to invest in R&D is essential for 
staying ahead of technological advancements 
and developing cutting-edge solutions. The
company’s R&D initiatives focus on explor-
ing new technologies, enhancing existing 
products and addressing emerging market 
needs. By fostering a culture of innovation 
and supporting its R&D efforts, NETSOL will 
continue to deliver solutions that lead the
industry, address the evolving challenges 
faced by its clients, and essentially, continue 
to futureproof their operations. 
Collaboration with industry leaders, associa-
tions and partners  
Collaborating with industry leaders, finance 
and leasing associations as well as tech-
nology partners is a key strategy for driving 
innovation. These partnerships provide access 
to new technologies, research insights and 
collaborative opportunities. By engaging with 
leading experts and organizations, NETSOL 
can accelerate its innovation efforts and
bring advanced solutions to market more 
effectively.
IMPACT OF COMPANY BUSINESS ON 
THE ENVIRNOMENT 
Amidst the growing number of climate-relat-
ed events worldwide, responsible businesses 
are increasingly focusing on climate and 
environmental sustainability. As a software
development company rather than a manu-
facturing entity, NETSOL’s operations inher-
ently have minimal environmental impact. 
However, as a global player, the company is 
equally committed to environmental preser-
vation through the adoption of sustainable 
practices.
Recognizing the challenges posed by global 
climate change, NETSOL acknowledges its 
responsibility as a global entity to address 
this issue. With its borderless operations, 
the company is determined to leverage all 
available resources to combat climate change.
In pursuit of this goal, NETSOL actively 
eliminates wasteful practices and optimizes 
energy efficiency across its processes.
Digitization is central to a paperless organi-
zation, and NETSOL’s flagship product, NFS 
Ascent, along with its digital transformation
solutions like NFS Digital and other offerings, 
empower clients to reduce their reliance on 
paper. By fostering a paperless ecosystem, 
these digital solutions contribute to a positive 
environmental impact. Within NETSOL’s own 
global operations, paper usage has been
significantly reduced, and the company con-
tinues to actively pursue further reductions in 
paper consumption.
CHANGES DURING FINANCIAL YEAR 
CONCERNING NATURE OF THE BUSI-
NESS OF THE COMPANY OR OF ITS 
SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT OPERA-
TION
The nature of the Company’s business, as
well as that of its subsidiaries and joint oper-
ations, has remained unchanged.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
 A detailed report on company’s initiatives 
with respect to corporate social responsibility 
aligned with United Nations defined sustaina-
bility goals is also annexed herewith.
ADEQUACY OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL 
CONTROLS
The Board holds ultimate responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining robust internal 
controls over financial reporting. Our inde-
pendent internal audit department reports 
functionally to the Board Audit Committee
and administratively to the CEO. Each year, 
the Board Audit Committee approves the 
audit plan, which is based on an annual as-
sessment of key operating areas. The internal 
audit department provides recommendations 
to address any control lapses, which are taken
up by the management to remediate control 
lapses. Observations are shared quarterly 
with the Board Audit Committee, the CEO, 
and the relevant divisional management.
The role of the internal audit function contin-
ues to evolve in response to events, risks, and
regulatory changes impacting the Company, 
ensuring that its mandate remains aligned 
56
NETSOL Technologies Limited
56
NETSOL Technologies Limited
with organizational objectives. Our internal 
controls are designed to offer reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of our 
financial reporting and the preparation of 
external financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Stand-
ards (IFRS). However, due to the inherent 
limitations of any internal control system, 
management acknowledges that there may 
be limitations in the effectiveness of these 
controls, and thus only reasonable assurance 
can be provided. Nonetheless, the Compa-
ny maintains an effective internal control 
framework, characterized by clear structures, 
defined authority limits, accountabilities, and 
well-established policies and procedures for 
review processes.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The statement of compliance under the Listed
Companies (Code of Corporate Governance), 
Regulations 2019 is attached with this report.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The Company does not pay remuneration 
to non-executive directors including the 
independent director except fee for attending 
the meetings. The Company will reimburse
or may incur expenses on travelling and 
accommodation of Directors in relation to 
attending of Board and its Committees meet-
ings. The aggregate amount of remuneration 
of executive directors, including their salary, 
perquisites, benefits and performance-linked
incentives are disclosed in the annexed finan-
cial statements.
DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION 
(DE&I)
At NETSOL, we view diversity, equity, and 
inclusion (DEI) as cornerstones of our organ-
izational culture and success. We understand 
that a diverse workforce enhances creativity,
drives innovation, and leads to better deci-
sion-making. Our commitment to leadership 
diversity is reflected in our women-led 
departments, where female leaders are 
empowered to inspire and guide their teams. 
This commitment goes hand-in-hand with 
our zero-discrimination policy, which estab-
lishes a workplace free from bias, ensuring 
that every employee is treated with respect 
and dignity, regardless of their background. 
We have stringent policies in place, such as 
transport facilities, maternity leaves, sub-
sidized sanitary products, anti-harassment
regulations and in-house health support, to 
reinforce a sense of community within our 
organization.
As an equal opportunity employer, we actively 
seek to hire differently-abled individuals, 
recognizing that their unique perspectives 
and talents contribute significantly to our
collective strength. We provide the necessary 
accommodations and support to create an 
inclusive environment that allows everyone 
to thrive.
In our efforts to promote DEI, we celebrate 
key initiatives such as workshops, mentor-
ship programs, and community engagement
activities that foster understanding and col-
laboration among employees. By reinforcing 
our commitment to DEI through strategic 
initiatives and continuous dialogue, we aim 
to create a culture where everyone feels 
valued and empowered to share their ideas
and perspectives. At NETSOL, we believe that 
embracing diversity is not just a responsi-
bility but a vital pathway to innovation and 
success in our industry.

The following highlights the steps NETSOL Technologies takes as an entity to play its part 
in achieving the below mentioned goals set by the United Nations.
ENVIRNOMENT
AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY
• 
Solar Energy: Taking a significant step toward renewable energy, Netsol is in the process
of installing solar panels. This investment in solar energy not only reduces our reliance on 
conventional power sources but also demonstrates our dedication to contributing to a more 
sustainable future.
• 
Data center and server rooms, being large consumers of energy in an IT landscape, have
been standardized using an eco-friendly room design that incorporates power and cooling 
best practices
• 
‘Be Responsible – Save Electricity’ Campaign: Our “Save Electricity” campaign encourages 
employees to adopt energy-saving habits, such as turning off ACs, computers, and chargers
when not in use, and maintaining AC temperatures at 26°C. Through these efforts, we are 
fostering a culture of responsibility and conservation within our organization.
• 
Maintained Temperature: Maintained a consistent temperature of 26°C across all halls for 
optimal energy usage. 
•
Focused Work Hours: Implemented a 6 pm to 12 pm ‘One Hall’ work trend to optimize 
energy consumption by centralizing workspace.
• 
Usage of LED lights: Not only do LED lights create a brighter, more inviting workspace, but
they also significantly contribute to our energy efficiency goals. They also use up to 80% less 
energy compared to traditional lighting.
RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION
• 
‘Save Food’ Initiative: We are committed to reducing waste and promoting responsible
consumption. Our Save Food Initiative encourages employees to be mindful of their food 
choices, resulting in a remarkable 50% reduction in food consumption. By fostering a 
culture of awareness and efficiency, we contribute to a more sustainable approach to food 
resources.

step in our collective fight against climate change. Trees release oxygen and filter pollutants 
from the air, enhancing the quality of the air we breathe. They absorb carbon dioxide, a major
contributor to global warming, helping mitigate its impact. 
• 
Clean-Up Drive for Climate Action: Employees actively participated in the ‘Ring Road Clean 
Up Drive’, symbolizing a collective commitment to combat climate challenges. 
•
Carpooling Initiative: Employees continue carpooling to reduce carbon emissions and fuel 
consumption. Further, our free van facility for our female employees also reduces emissions 
by having one vehicle pick/drop multiple people to and from their residences. 
•
‘Be Responsible - Save The Environment’ Campaign: Raised awareness about responsible 
environmental practices.
• 
Recycling: Recycling bins are strategically placed throughout all halls, ensuring easy access 
for employees. Employees are actively encouraged to segregate waste, including glass,
paper and plastic at the office.
• 
‘Go Green, Go Clean’ Campaign: The company collected 1,010 Kg of paper & plastic for 
recycling, demonstrating commitment to responsible waste management. Employees are

We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable

Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of 
the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of

(the code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our

Key Audit Matters 
 
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of 
our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters. 
 
Following are the key audit matters:
Key Audit Matters 
How the matter was addressed in our audit 
1. Revenue Recognition 
Refer to notes 4.10 & 29 to the financial 
statements. 
 
The Company has earned revenue of Rs. 
9,280.65 million for the year ending June 30, 
2024. The Company’s revenue is derived
from multiple revenue streams, as referred 
Our key audit procedures included the following: 
 
• 
Obtained an understanding of the Company’s 
processes and related internal controls for 
revenue recognition and on a sample basis, 
tested the operating effectiveness of those 
controls. 
85
Annual Report 2024
85
Annual Report 2024
to in Note 29 to the accompanying financial 
statements, including license, rendering of 
services and subscription and support. Each 
stream has its own revenue recognition 
policy based on the nature of revenue and 
underlying contractual arrangements as
referred to in Note 4.10. Certain contracts 
with 
customers 
require 
significant 
management judgment to determine the 
appropriate timing and method of revenue 
recognition. 
 
Large contracts are typically bundled and 
often include license, rendering of services
and subscription and support revenues. 
 
We consider revenue recognition as a key 
audit matter due to revenue being one of the 
key performance indicators of the Company 
with multiple revenue streams, inherent risk 
of material misstatement and significant 
increase in revenue from last year.
• 
Assessed the appropriateness of the Company’s 
revenue recognition policies and their compliance 
with 
applicable 
accounting 
and 
reporting 
standards. 
 
• 
Compared a sample of transactions comprising of 
various revenue streams during the year with
underlying documentation including contracts 
with customers, sales invoices and where 
relevant, underlying time sheets, completion 
certificates and other supporting documents to 
assess whether the revenue was recorded in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Company’s 
revenue 
accounting 
policy 
and
applicable 
financial 
reporting framework. 
 
• 
Agreed license revenue to signed contracts, file 
transfer protocol logs or software license 
agreements. 
 
• 
Agreed the revenue to subsequent payment as 
evidence of collectability. 
 
• 
Critically assessed the significant management
judgments applied in determining the timing and 
method of revenue recognition, particularly for 
complex 
contracts 
requiring 
significant 
estimation. 
 
• 
Performed a comparative analysis of the revenue 
recognized in the current year with that of the
prior year, investigating any significant variances 
or trends. 
 
• 
Performed cut-off procedures on sales to ensure 
revenue has been recorded in the correct period. 
 
• 
Checked receipts from customers to whom sales 
were made. 
 
• 
Considered adequacy of the disclosures provided
under the revenue standard IFRS-15 and 
assessed the completeness and mathematical 
accuracy of the relevant disclosures. 
 
2. Valuation of trade debts and contract assets  
Refer to note 4.12, 4.13, 9, 11 and  
12 
to 
the 
financial 
statements. 
  
The Company’s gross trade debts and
contract assets as at June 30, 2024 are Rs. 
5,575.80 million and Rs. 1,851.98 million 
respectively against which allowances for 
expected credit losses of Rs. 280.60 million 
and Rs 54.09 million have been recognized.   
Our key audit procedures included the following: 
 
•
Considered management’s process of application 
of ECL model to calculate impairment loss against 
trade debts and contract assets.  
 
• 
Evaluated key decisions made by the Company’s 
management with respect to estimates and

NETSOL Technologies Limited
The loss allowance for expected credit losses 
(ECL model) on trade debts and contract 
assets has been recognized in the financial 
statements using the guidance included in 
IFRS 
9 
‘Financial 
Instruments’. 
Determination of ECL provision for trade
debts and contract assets requires significant 
judgment 
and 
assumptions 
including 
consideration of factors such as historical 
credit loss experience, time value of money 
and 
forward-looking 
macroeconomic 
information.  
 
We have considered this area as a key audit
matter due to its size, representing 49.35% 
of the total assets of the Company as at June 
30, 2024 and the significant management 
judgements involved in valuation. 
 
judgements in relation to application of the ECL 
model. 
 
• 
Evaluated the ECL model for appropriateness of 
the

•

trade debts on sample basis and evaluated 
responses received.  
 
• 
Checked subsequent clearance of balances due
as of June 30, 2024 on sample basis.  
 
• 
Assessed financial impacts and appropriateness 
of disclosures made in the financial statements to 
determine whether they are complied with the 
accounting and reporting standards as applicable 
in Pakistan.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon 
 
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information 
included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report 
thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express 
any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information 
is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this 
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 
 
Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and the requirements
of the Companies Act, 2017 (XIX of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is 
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability 
to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 
 
Board of directors of the Company are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting 
process.

Annual Report 2024
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report
that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that 
an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment 
and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 
 
• 
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain 
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the 
override of internal control. 
 
• 
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. 
 
• 
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management. 
 
• 
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to
events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit 
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions 
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 
 
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including 
the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and 
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the board of directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related
safeguards. 
 
From the matters communicated with the board of directors, we determine those matters that were of 
most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes 
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter 
should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would
reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Initial Application of ‘IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information’

During the year, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) has withdrawn Technical Release 27 ‘IAS 12, 
Income Taxes (Revised 2012)’ and issued the ‘IAS 12 Application Guidance on Accounting for Minimum Taxes and Final
Taxes’ (the Guidance). Accordingly, in accordance with the Guidance, the Company has changed its accounting policy to 
recognise minimum and final taxes as ‘Levy’ under IAS 37 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets” 
which were previously being recognised as ‘Income tax’.
The Company has accounted for the effects of these changes in accounting policy retrospectively under IAS 8 ”Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors” and the corresponding figures have been restated in these
unconsolidated financial statements. The effects of restatements are as follows:

Other than the aforementioned standards, interpretations, and amendments, IASB has also issued the following 
standards, which have yet not been notified locally by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan 
(SECP) as at the reporting date:
- IFRS 18 -  Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements
- IFRS 19 - IFRS 19 ‘Subsidiaries Without Public Accountability - Disclosures’
- IFRS 01 - First Time Adoption of IFRS
- IFRS S1 - General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information
- IFRS S2 - Climate-Related Disclosures
The management believes that adoption of the new standards, amendments and interpretations, which 
are in issue but not yet effective, is not likely to have any material impact, on the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of items in the financial statements for current and future periods and foreseeable 
future transactions.
3.   Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with approved accounting and reporting standards, as applicable in
Pakistan, requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies 
and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to 
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values
of assets, liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The areas involving higher degree of judgement or complexity included in these financial statements are as follows:
- Provision for expected credit losses on accounts receivable / contract assets - Note 4.17, 11 & 12
- Provision for taxation - Note 4.6
- Useful lives and recoverable amounts of depreciable assets - Note 4.1 & 6
- Useful lives of intangible assets - Note 4.2 & 7
- Contingencies - Note 4.8 & 28
- Leases - Note 5.1 & 22
- Revenue recognition - Note 4.10 & 29
- Long term investment - Note 4.18 & 8
- Fair value of employee share options - Note 4.5 & 20
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are only effective for accounting periods, beginning 
on or after the date mentioned against each of them. These standards, interpretations and the amendments are
either irrelevant to the Company’s operations or are not expected to have significant impact on the Company’s 
financial statements other than certain additional disclosures:

Material Accounting Policy Information
The Company adopted disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS practice statements 2 ‘Making Ma-
teriality Judgments’) from 01 July, 2023. Although amendments did not result in any changes to the accounting policies them-
selves, they impact the accounting policy information disclosed in the financial statements. The amendments require disclo-
sure of ‘material’, rather than ‘significant’ accounting policies.
The material accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the periods presented except otherwise stated.
4.1 Property and equipment
(i) Owned assets
Property and equipment, except for freehold land, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and identified 
impairment losses (if any). Freehold land is stated at cost less any identified impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged by applying straight line method to write off the cost over the remaining useful life of the 
assets. Rates of depreciation are stated in note 6.1. Depreciation method, residual value and useful lives of assets
are reviewed at least at each reporting date and adjusted if impact on depreciation is significant.
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary
for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation of an asset ceases when the 
asset is derecognized. Depreciation does not cease when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use unless 
the asset is fully depreciated.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amounts or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the 
cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of property and equipment is removed from the statement of financial position upon scrapping 
or disposal or when no future economic benefit is expected from its use, scrapping or disposal.
Day to day maintenance and normal repairs are charged to profit or loss as and when incurred. Gain or loss on 
scrapping or disposal of assets, if any, is charged to profit or loss. Gain or loss on disposal of assets is the difference
between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset disposed off.
(ii) Right of use assets
The Company recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying
asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and 
identified impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use
assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at 
or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to
obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated 
over the shorter of their estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are amortized over the useful
life of the assets using straight line method at the rates given in note 6.2. Amortization on additions begins when 
it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the
manner intended by management. Amortization of an asset ceases when the asset is derecognized. Right-of-use 
assets are also subject to impairment.
(iii) Capital work in progress
Capital work in progress is stated at cost less any identified impairment losses. It represents expenditure incurred
on property and equipment during construction and installation. Cost also includes applicable borrowing costs 
under IAS 23. These expenditures are transferred to relevant assets’ category as and when assets are available for use.
4.2
Intangible assets
Research and software products development
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless 
technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, it is probable that future economic benefits will
flow to the Company, the Company has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and cost 
can be measured reliably.

Annual Report 2024
Note 4, Material Accounting Policy Information - Continued…
There are two components of intangible assets:
a.  In-house developed intangible assets
b.  Intangible assets acquired from market
(a) In-house developed intangible assets
The Company may capitalize certain computer software development costs in accordance with IAS-38 “Intangible 
Assets”. Costs incurred internally to create a computer software product or to develop an enhancement to an
existing product are charged to expense when incurred as research and development expense until technological 
feasibility for the respective product is established.  Thereafter, all software development costs may be capitalized
and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or recoverable amount.  Capitalization will cease when the product 
or enhancement is available for general release to customers.
Amortization is charged on straight line basis over the useful life of the intangible assets. All intangible assets with
an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at each reporting date. Rates of amortization are stated in note 7.
(b) Intangible assets acquired from market
Intangible assets acquired from market are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and identified impairment 
losses, if any.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amounts or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, 
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably.  All other expenses are charged to profit or loss when they occur.
Amortization is charged by applying straight line method to write off the cost over the remaining useful life of
the intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. All intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested 
for impairment at each reporting date.  Amortization on additions of acquired intangible assets begins when it is
available for use  i.e. (i.e., the month when the intangible is ready for use) while no amortization is charged for the 
month in which the asset is disposed off.  Rates of amortization are stated in note 6.1.
4.3
Impairment of non financial asset
The Company continually assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be 
impaired. If such indication exists, the carrying amounts of such assets are reviewed to assess whether they are
recorded in excess of their recoverable amount. Where carrying values exceed the respective recoverable amount, 
assets are written down to their recoverable amounts and the resulting impairment loss is recognized in profit or
loss for the year. The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets’ fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Where an impairment loss is recognized, the depreciation charge is adjusted in the future periods to allocate the 
assets’ revised carrying amount over its estimated useful life.
4.4
Foreign currency translation and transaction
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated in Pak Rupees at the foreign exchange rate prevailing 
at the date of transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Pak Rupees at
the foreign exchange rates  prevailing at the reporting date.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at 
historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.  Non-monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the date when fair values were determined.  All exchange differences are charged to statement of 
profit or loss. 
4.5
Staff benefits
(i) Retirement benefits
The Company operates a defined contributory Provident Fund for its permanent employees. Contributions are made 
equally by the Company and the employee at 8% of basic salary in the Provident Fund on monthly basis. Company’s
contribution is recognized as a cost in profit or loss. The fund is administrated by the Trustees.
(ii) Short-term benefits
Short-term benefits to employees are calculated without discounting and are recognized as cost when related 
services are received.

(iii) Employees’ share option scheme
The Company operates an equity settled share based Employee’ Share Option Scheme (“Scheme”). The fair value of 
options granted is determined at the grant date and is recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight
line basis over the vesting period in profit or loss with corresponding credit to equity as employee compensation 
reserve. Fair value of options is arrived at using Black Scholes Pricing Model.
When the options are exercised, the proceeds received equivalent to the face value of related shares is credited to 
share capital and any amount above the share capital is credited to share premium account.
4.6
Taxation
Provision for current tax is based on taxable income for the year determined in accordance with the prevailing laws 
for taxation of income. The charge for tax on income is calculated at the current rates of taxation as applicable after
taking into account tax credit and tax rebates available, if any. Income tax expense is recognized in statement of 
profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized
in equity. Charge for tax expense also includes adjustments where necessary, relating to prior years which arise 
from assessments finalized during the current year.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the statement of financial position method in respect of all temporary differences
arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of the taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally
recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax
losses and tax credits can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the year 
when the differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting
date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of profit or loss, except in the case of items credited or 
charged to other comprehensive income in which case it is included in other comprehensive income.
Expenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of sales tax, except:
-  When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, 
in which case, the sales tax is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense 
item, as applicable.
-  When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included the net amount of sales tax 
recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
statement of financial position.
In accordance with the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, computation of final taxes is not based on taxable income. 
Therefore, as per IAS 12 Application Guidance on Accounting for Minimum Taxes and Final Taxes issued by the ICAP,
these fall within the scope of IFRIC 21 / IAS 37 and accordingly have been classified as levy in these unconsolidated 
financial statements, except for taxes on dividends on the Company’s investments in subsidiaries and associates
which are specifically within the scope of IAS 12 and hence, these continue to be categorised as current income tax.
4.7
Trade and other payables
Liabilities for trade and other payables are carried at cost which is the fair value of the consideration to be paid in
future for goods and / or services received, whether or not billed to the Company.
Liabilities for trade and other payable in foreign currency are revalued by applying the exchange rate applicable on 
each reporting date.
4.8
Provisions and contingencies
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past 
events and, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation and reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and 
adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. Where outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not
probable, a contingent liability is disclosed, unless the possibility of outflow is remote.
4.9
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at current or saving accounts held with banks, fixed deposits
and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. These also include facilities of running finance that form an 
integral part of the Company’s cash management.

4.10 Revenue recognition
The Company follows IFRS 15 for the recognition of revenue from all its revenue streams. The Company determines 
revenue recognition using the following step wise approach:
- Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
- Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
- Determination of the transaction price;
- Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
- Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied
The Company records the amount of revenue and related costs by considering whether it is a principal (gross 
presentation) or an agent (net presentation) by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer. The Company
has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it typically controls the services 
before transferring them to the customer. Revenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other taxes collected 
from customers and remitted to government authorities.
The Company has two primary revenue streams i.e. core revenue or non-core revenue.
Core Revenue:
The Company generates its core revenue from the export of (1) Software Licenses, (2) Services, which include
implementation, customization and other consulting services, and (3) Subscription and Support, which includes 
subscription and post contract support, of its enterprise software solutions for the lease and finance industry.  The
Company offers its software using both traditional on-premises licensing model and Software as a Service (SaaS) 
model. The on-premises model involves the sale or license of software on a perpetual basis to customers who take
possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware.
Non-Core Revenue:
The Company generates its non-core revenue by providing Business Process Outsourcing (“BPO”) services and 
other services (including support services to its local customers).
Performance Obligations
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. The 
transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the
performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised services to the customer. The Company identifies 
the performance obligations at contract inception so that the Company can monitor and account for the performance 
obligations over the life of the contract.
The Company’s contract which contains multiple performance obligations generally consists of the initial sale 
of licenses and a professional services engagement. Contracts generally have multiple performance obligations
as customers purchase maintenance support and services in addition to the licenses. The Company’s single 
performance obligation arrangements are typically maintenance renewals and professional services engagements.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling 
price (”SSP”) for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract’s transaction
price to each performance obligation using its best estimate for the SSP.
Information about the Company’s performance obligations are summarized below:
a) Software licenses:
Performance obligation is satisfied and revenue from software licenses is recognized at the point in time when
transfer of control for software is occurred either upon physical delivery of license through CD, USB or electronically 
using FTP or delivery of the license key by other electronic methods which provide immediate availability of the
product to the customer. The Company’s typical payment terms tend to vary by region, but its standard payment 
terms are within 120 days of invoice.

Financial Statements

NETSOL Technologies Limited
102
NETSOL Technologies Limited
b) Subscription and support:
Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer 
commencing when the product is made available to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 12
to 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and 
typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 120 days of invoice. Performance obligation
against support  revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support period, which in most instances is 
one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates,
maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. 
The Company’s customers purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software
licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their support services contracts annually and typical payment 
terms provide that customers make payment within 120 days of invoice.
c) Professional services:
Performance obligation is satisfied and revenue from professional services is recognized over the time and typically 
comprises implementation, development, customization, enhancements, data migration, training or other consulting
services. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services 
ranging from software installation to data migration and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software
to operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes revenue from time-and-material arrangements 
as the services are performed.  In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as
measured by efforts incurred to date, compared to total estimated efforts to complete the services project. The 
management applies judgment while estimating efforts to complete the services projects.  A number of internal
and external factors can affect these estimates, including utilization and efficiency variances and specification 
and testing requirement changes.  Services are generally invoiced upon milestones as agreed in the contract and 
payments are typically due in 120 days after invoice.
d) BPO services:
Revenue from BPO services is recognized when earned. The Company recognizes revenue on issuance of billing to 
the customer. Payment terms are upto 120 days after invoice.
e) Miscellaneous income
Interest on bank deposits is recognized and received on a time proportion basis on the principal amount outstanding 
and at the rate applicable.
Rental income is recognized on time proportion basis. Payment terms are 30 days.
Dividend is recognized as income when the right of receipt is established. Payment terms are 15 working days after 
declaration of dividend.
Miscellaneous income is recognized on receipt basis, and is recognised in other income in statement of profit or loss.
Contract Modifications
Contract modifications involving changes in scope or price are treated as separate contracts if they add distinct 
performance obligations at standalone prices. If not, they are either treated as a termination of the existing contract and
creation of a new one or, if no new distinct obligations arise, adjustments are made on a cumulative catch-up basis i.e. 
recognizing in the current period the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods according to the revised 
performance obligations.
Significant Judgments
Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under IFRS 15 for the 
Company’s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.
Judgment is required to determine the stand alone selling price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation. The 
Company rarely licenses or sells products on a stand-alone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range
of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because the Company 
does not sell the license, product or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that
may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes 
various factors, including its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer
demographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for 
each distinct product or service delivered to customers.
103
Annual Report 2024
103
Annual Report 2024
The stand-alone selling price of the licenses was measured primarily through an analysis of pricing that 
management evaluated when quoting prices to customers. Although the Company has no history of selling its
software separately from support and other services, the Company does have historical experience with amending 
contracts with customers to provide additional modules of its software or providing those modules at an optional
price.  This information guides the Company in assessing the stand-alone selling price of the Company’s software, 
since the Company can observe instances where a customer had a particular component of the Company’s software
that was essentially priced separate from other goods and services that the Company delivered to that customer.
The Company recognises revenue from implementation and customization services using percentage of estimated
man-days that the work requires. The Company believes the level of effort to complete the services is best measured 
by the amount of time (measured as an employee working for one day on implementation/customization work) that
is required to complete the implementation or customization work.  The Company continuously reviews its estimate 
of man-days required to complete implementation and customization services.
Revenue is recognized over time for the Company’s subscription, support and fixed fee professional services that 
are separate performance obligations.  For the Company’s professional services, revenue is recognized over time,
generally using man-days expended to measure progress. Judgement is required in estimating project status 
and efforts necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates,
including man-day rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.
If a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of
a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition 
purposes. The Company exercises significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in
determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single arrangement. The Company’s 
judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of
consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the 
periods involved.
If a contract includes variable consideration, the Company exercises judgment in estimating the amount of
consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a 
customer. When estimating variable consideration, the Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances.
Variable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price only when it is probable that a significant 
reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions
There are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under IFRS 15 that impact timing of revenue 
recognition and the Company’s disclosures. Below is a list of practical expedients the Company applied in the 
adoption and application of IFRS 15:
a)  The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected 
within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.
b) The Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the
amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing 
expense in the statement of profit or loss.
c)   The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts that have an
original expected duration of one year or less.
d)  The Group does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the 
Group recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies
to time-and-material engagements).
4.11
Costs to obtain a contract
The Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any reporting date. In 
general, the Company incurs few direct incremental costs for obtaining new customer contracts. We rarely incur
incremental costs to review or otherwise enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, our sales 
personnel receive fees that we refer to as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new
customers. Our sales personnel are required to perform additional duties beyond signing of new deals, including 
account management of customers and cash collection efforts.

Contract assets
A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for services transferred to the customer. If the Company 
has satisfied the performance obligation, either in full or partially, by transferring services to a customer before the
invoice is issued or payment is due, a contract asset is recognized for the earned consideration that is conditional.
4.13 Trade receivables
A receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the
passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Refer to accounting policies of financial 
assets in section 4.17 (i) Financial instruments – initial recognition and measurement.
4.14 Contract liabilities
A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received 
consideration from the customer in advance or an amount of consideration is due. If a customer pays consideration
before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognized when the amount 
is received or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the 
Company performs under the contract.
4.15
Related party transactions
The Company enters into transactions with related parties at an arm’s length basis. Prices for transactions with 
related parties are determined using admissible valuation methods, except in extremely rare circumstances where,
subject to approval of the Board of Directors, it is in the best interest of the Company to do so.
4.16
Off-setting of financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the financial statements only when
there is legally enforceable right to set-off the recognized amount and the Company intends either to settle on a 
net basis, or to realize the assets and to settle the liabilities simultaneously.

Financial instruments
A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or 
equity instrument of another entity.
(i) Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, and subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value 
through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss.
The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow 
characteristics and the Company’s business model for managing them.
The Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus transaction cost. In the case of a financial 
asset not at fair value through profit or loss at its fair value.
Subsequent measurement
For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
- Financial assets at amortized cost (debt instruments)
- Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments)
- Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon
derecognition (equity instruments)
- Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Derecognition
A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is
primarily derecognized (i.e., removed from the Company’s statement of financial position) when rights to receive 
cash flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all 
risks and rewards of ownership.

Annual Report 2024

Annual Report 2024
Impairment of financial assets
The Company recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair 
value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance
with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of 
the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held
or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
ECLs are recognized in two stages. For credit exposures, for which there has not been a significant increase in
credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are 
possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a
significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over 
the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Company applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, 
the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs
at each reporting date. The Company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss 
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment, based on
the groupings for various customers segments that have similar patterns (i.e. by geography and customer wise).
(ii) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss,
loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as 
appropriate.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net 
of directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial
liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses on liabilities held 
for trading are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition
at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IFRS 9 
are satisfied. The Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using 
the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognized in the unconsolidated statement of profit
or loss when liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Other financial liabilities are also subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Interest expense 
and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Any gain or loss on de-
recognition is also recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. 
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms,
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as 
derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability. Difference in the respective carrying amounts 
is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

4.18 Investments
a)
Investment in subsidiary
Investment in subsidiary is initially recognized at cost. At subsequent reporting date, recoverable amounts are 
estimated to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any, and carrying amount of investment is adjusted
accordingly. Impairment losses are recognized as expense in the statement of profit or loss. Where impairment 
loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amounts of investment are increased to its revised recoverable amount,
limited to the extent of initial cost of investment. Reversal of impairment losses are recognized in the statement 
of profit or loss.
b)
Investment in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to
participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over 
those policies.
The considerations made in determining significant influence are similar to those necessary to determine control
over subsidiaries. The Company’s investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the
investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Company’s share of net assets of the associate since the 
acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not 
tested for impairment separately.
The statement of profit or loss reflects the Company’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change 
in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Company’s other comprehensive
income. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Company 
recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity.
The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the 
Company, unless otherwise stated. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line 
with those of the group.
The Company periodically determines whether it is necessary to recognize any impairment loss on its investment 
in its associate or not. The Company determines on annual basis whether there is any objective evidence that the
investment in associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Company calculates the amount of impairment 
as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then recognizes the
loss within ‘Share of profit or loss of an associate’ in the statement of profit or loss.
Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Company measures and recognizes any retained investment
at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and 
the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognized in profit or loss.
5.
Summary Of Other Accounting Policies
5.1
Lease liabilities
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value 
of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-
substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or 
a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The variable lease payments that do not
depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers 
the payment occurs.
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease
commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement 
date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease
payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a 
change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to 
purchase the underlying asset.
107
Annual Report 2024
107
Annual Report 2024
Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that 
have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It
also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered of low value. Lease 
payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal & termination options
The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered
by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to 
terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew or 
to terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise
the renewal & termination. After the commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a 
significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to 
exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy).
5.2
Advances and deposits
These are recognized at nominal amount which is fair value of considerations to be received in future.
5.3
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction /acquisition of qualifying assets are capitalized up to the
date, including the period when technical and administrative work is carried on; the respective assets are available 
for the intended use. All other mark-up, interest and other related charges are taken to the statement of profit or
loss currently. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their 
intended use.
5.4
Dividend and appropriation to reserves
Dividend and appropriation to reserves are recognized in the financial statements in the period in which these
are approved. However, if they are approved after the reporting period but before the financial statements are 
authorized for issue they are disclosed in the notes to financial statements.
5.5
Fair value
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organized financial markets is determined by 
reference to quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the statement of financial position date.  Where
there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques.  Such techniques include using 
recent arm’s length market transaction; reference to the current market value of another instrument, which has
substantially similar characteristics, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.
5.6
Earnings per share
The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit
after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares 
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary share holders
of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares 
into ordinary shares.

Description of scheme
As per the approved employee stock option scheme, the Board and the compensation committee granted three million stock op-
tions to employees on December 27, 2021 at a grant price of Rs. 77.84 per option. No amount is paid or payable by any employee
on receipt of the option. No option carries the right to vote or dividend. According to the scheme, 50% of the options will become 
exercisable after completion of 12 months from date of grant, another 30% of the granted option after completion of 24 months
from the grant date and the remaining 20% of the granted option will become exercisable after completion of 36 months from the 
date of grant. The options are exercisable within a period of 10 years with un-exercised options to lapse on December 27, 2031.
Measurement of fair value
The Company uses “Black Scholes Pricing Model” to determine the fair value of options at the grant date.  Fair value at grant date 
of the equity settled share based arrangement was calculated using the following assumptions.

28. Contingencies and Commitments
28.1 Contingencies
Mr. Ahsan Zubair, an ex-employee of the Company has filed a case for recovery of damages dated January 26, 2013
for malicious prosecution before the Honourable Civil Court, Lahore and has sought damages to the tune of Rs. 
500 million. The case was filed five years after a complaint lodged by NetSol Technologies Limited with Federal
Investigation Authority pertaining to use of NetSol’s IP without authority by a company formed by the employee 
and his partner who was also an ex-employee of the Company. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of
the case, including the nature of evidence of the plaintiff and the laws applicable, it can safely be inferred that, 
on merits, no case for damages is made out. This is also endorsed by the fact that the case is barred by the laws
relating to limitation. Moreover none of the ingredients forming basis for allowing a case of malicious prosecution 
are attracted. In the opinion of the legal advisor, the outcome of the case is expected in favour of the Company, 
hence, no provision is incorporated in these financial statements.
28.2 Commitments
Bank guarantees have been issued amounting to Rs. 60.93 million (2023: Rs. 36.21 million) against performance of 
various contracts, to LESCO and to Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited against its corporate credit cards.
The Company has capital commitments of Rs 1.32 million as at June 30, 2024 (2023: Nil).

41. Capital Risk Management
The Company’s objective when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going 
concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefit for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal
capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic 
conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend payment to 
shareholders or issue new shares.
The management seeks to maintain a balance between higher returns that might be possible with higher levels 
of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The Company finances its
operations through equity, borrowings and management of working capital with a view to maintain an appropriate 
mix between various sources of finance to minimize risk.
In line with the norms, the Company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net
debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non current) less cash 
and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the statement of financial position plus net
debt. As at the reporting date, the gearing ratio of the Company was worked out as under:

42. Financial Risk Management
42.1 Financial risk factors
The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk
and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s overall risk management programme focuses on having 
cost efficient funding as well as to manage financial risk to minimize earnings volatility and provide maximum return 
to shareholders.
The Board of Directors of the Company has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s 
risk management process. The management continually monitors the Company’s risk management process to ensure
that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management processes are reviewed regularly to 
reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities.
(a) Market risk
(i) Currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because 
of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Foreign currency risk arises mainly where receivables and payables exist due to transactions entered into foreign
currencies. The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on trade debts, payables and revenues which are entered in 
a currency other than Pak Rupees. Majority of the revenue of the Company is in currencies other than Pak Rupees. The
Company also holds cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies for working capital purposes. As at 
the reporting date, the Company’s exposure to currency risk was as follows:

(ii) Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market interest rates. Majority of the interest rate exposure arises from bank borrowings, lease liabilities,
term deposits, deposits in profit and loss/saving accounts with banks and investments in mutual funds. The Company 
mitigates its interest rate risk by investing available cash in mutual funds and bank deposits, generating more return 
compared to the finance cost.
The interest rate profile of the Company’s interest-bearing financial instruments as at the reporting date is as follows:

Annual Report 2024
The Company has no instruments subject to fixed interest rate. 
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
As at June 30, 2024, if floating interest rates had been 1% higher / lower with all other variables held constant, profit
before tax for the year would have been lower / higher by Rs. 7.74  million (2023: Rs. 3.75 million), mainly as a result 
of interest exposure on variable rate borrowings.
(iii) Other price risk
Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of 
changes in market prices (other than those arising from currency risk or interest rate risk), whether those changes
are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar 
financial instruments traded in the market. The Company is not exposed to significant other price risk.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer 
contract, leading to a financial loss. Credit risk of the Company arises from trade debts, loans and advances, trade
deposits, other receivables and deposits with banks.  To reduce exposure to credit risk, the Company has developed 
a formal approval process. The management assesses the credit quality of the customers, taking into account their
financial position, past experience and other factors and makes provision against those balances (if required). The 
utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated 
parties with a strong credit rating are accepted.
The Company monitors the credit quality of its financial assets with reference to historical performance of such 
assets and available external credit ratings, if any. As at June 30, 2024, the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal
to the carrying amount of the financial assets as detailed below:
The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual customer. At June 30, the Company had 31 
customers owing Rs. 5.58 billion. The Company has made allowances, where necessary, for potential losses on 
credits extended.
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Company uses a simplified approach to calculate expected credit 
losses (ECLs). A provision matrix has been established based on the Company’s historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. This matrix is based on 
the segments that exhibit similar patterns, such as geography and customer type.
The management estimates the recoverability of trade receivables on the basis of financial position and past 
history of its customers based on the objective evidence that it may not receive the amount due from the particular
customer. The provision is written off by the Company when it expects that it cannot recover the balance due. Any 
subsequent repayments in relation to amounts written off are credited directly to profit or loss.

(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Company will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial
liabilities. Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of 
funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. The Company follows an effective cash management and
planning process to ensure availability of funds and to take appropriate actions for new requirements. The Company’s liquidity 
management involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring
balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt financing plans. 
The table below analyses the Company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period
at the reporting date to contractual maturity dates. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted

Annual Report 2024
The contractual cash flows relating to the above financial liabilities have been determined on the basis of mark-up 
rate effective as at June 30. Rates of interest / mark - up and their maturities are given in the respective notes.
(d) Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value is an amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing 
parties in an arm’s length transaction. Consequently, differences may arise between the carrying value and the fair 
value estimates.
Fair value is determined on the basis of objective evidence at each reporting date. The management assessed that 
the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the 
short-term maturities of these instruments.
