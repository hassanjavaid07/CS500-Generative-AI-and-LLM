Chairman’s Review Report
As we reflect on the past financial year, I am both proud and invigorated by the strides our company has made. This period has been transformative for us, marked by significant achievements, challenges overcome and a reaffirmation of our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our clients and partners worldwide.
continue to be well-supported both financially and non- financially. We have implemented measures to enhance their job satisfaction, provide robust benefits and offer career development opportunities. Our goal is to foster a positive work environment where our global team feels valued and motivated.
Our commitment to flexibility and customization is demonstrated through all our product offerings and their ability to handle complex multi-country and multi- jurisdictional requirements. Whether it’s our core finance and leasing platform Ascent, our API-first products or our digital retail and mobility solutions, our technology is designed to support diverse business environments and adapt to evolving needs. We also continue to offer a range of professional services as well as cloud solutions and services in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Otoz, our fully digital, white-label platform for digital auto retail and mobility orchestration, was built in our Lahore, Pakistan office via our Unity R&D lab. The product has witnessed great success in the United States, with some customers that have already signed up for and are utilizing our Otoz platform. Following this, subsequently, we foresee more interest generated for this product in the North American region. We will continue to develop the roadmap for Otoz – for which the potential is vast as we continue to witness traction and anticipate interest via further client engagements in the coming years.
We also foresee continued interest in our suite of API- first, SaaS-based products – Appex Now. These products were developed specifically for the global credit, finance and leasing industry. Their availability through flexible, subscription-based pricing and lightning-fast onboarding has already resulted in these products being signed up for, and subsequently deployed by various financial institutions in the United Kingdom.
This year, our company had undertaken a strategic restructuring to enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs. By reducing the size of our workforce, we have achieved significant cost savings without any disruption to our operations. This adjustment has allowed us to maintain our commitment to delivering exceptional value and performance, and maintaining our position as a leading technology solutions provider primarily to the global asset finance and leasing industry.
Our focus remains on sustaining high operational standards while nurturing our talented workforce. We believe this approach will drive long-term success and maintain our position as a leading force in the industry. At NETSOL, we are deeply committed to the continuous development of our employees. We recognize that investing in our team’s growth is crucial for both their personal career advancement and our overall success.
To this end, we continue to offer comprehensive training programs designed to enhance skillsets and keep our staff at the forefront of industry trends and technologies. Through professional development and training, and by fostering a supportive and dynamic work environment, we empower our employees to deliver exceptional results and contribute to our ongoing success.
Our company has embarked on a journey to establish itself as a center of excellence in AI through Project Optimus. Our dedicated team of AI architects, data scientists and engineers are singularly focused on developing cutting- edge AI solutions. Project Optimus is designed to enhance our internal software development processes, making them more efficient and effective. By harnessing advanced AI technologies, we aim to drive innovation and optimize our existing offerings. This strategic focus on AI not only promises to elevate our internal capabilities, but also ensures that we continue to deliver top-tier solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients.
NETSOL is poised to be recognized as a leader in AI initiatives by proactively setting the standard rather than following market trends. Over the past two years, we have diligently built a solid foundation in AI and ML, focusing on creating a strong infrastructure that benefits our organization at a fundamental level. We have concentrated on developing and integrating AI solutions that deliver genuine value and efficiency. Our strategic approach has already yielded several successful proof of concepts within the company, demonstrating our commitment to harnessing AI’s transformative potential.
Despite the reduction in staff, we have ensured that we have retained our best performing employees, who

Our goal is to foster meaningful engagements with these clients, guiding them through the evolving landscape of AI and its implications for their businesses.

As we close another fiscal year, I am both proud and humbled to present our annual report, reflecting a year of significant achievements and strategic advancements at NETSOL Technologies. Serving as a trusted partner and technology provider primarily to the global asset finance and leasing industry, our mission has always been to deliver transformative solutions that empower our clients to navigate an increasingly complex and dynamic landscape.
The financial services sector continues to undergo rapid evolution, driven by technological advancements, regulatory changes and shifting market demands. At NETSOL, we have embraced these changes as opportunities to enhance our offerings and deliver value to our clients. This year, we have made remarkable strides in advancing our technology solutions, expanding our market presence and deepening our relationships with key stakeholders.
We are thrilled to conclude the financial year 2023-2024 on a high note. The efforts invested throughout the past year are now yielding impressive results, marked by significant top-line growth and an improved bottom line. This success can be attributed to two key factors. Firstly, a number of initiatives taken in the past few years, including the introduction of flexible, subscription-based pricing for our solutions, have proven highly effective. This shift has delivered substantial positive outcomes, enhancing our ability to attain new customers. Secondly, our cost-cutting measures have also bought desired results. These measures involved not only reducing the size of our workforce, but also meticulously evaluating and reducing costs across all areas of our business.
As we look ahead, NETSOL’s management is optimistic about the upcoming fiscal year 2024-2025. We anticipate new opportunities to further increase our

2. MARKET DYNAMICS
Economic conditions and market demand
Economic conditions play a significant role in shaping business performance. Fluctuations in economic growth, inflation rates and poli- cies can impact market demand for technol- ogy solutions. As NETSOL navigates these uncertainties, it continues to remain agile and responsive to market changes. Understand- ing emerging industry needs and adapting offerings accordingly will be key to sustaining growth and capturing new opportunities.
Regulatory changes
The regulatory environment for technology companies is continually evolving. Data pro- tection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA, have set new standards for data privacy and compliance. Additionally, regulations related to AI and technology ethics are gaining prom- inence. Staying abreast of regulatory changes and ensuring compliance is essential for avoiding legal risks and maintaining a positive reputation. NETSOL’s proactive approach to regulatory compliance includes regular audits, updates to its policies and engagement with regulatory bodies.
3. CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND PREFER- ENCES
Personalization and customer experience
In today’s competitive landscape, delivering a personalized customer experience is crucial.

meet the evolving demands of its clients and strengthen its market position.
4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
Global competitors
NETSOL is facing competition from a number of players both on a regional and global level. There are a number of companies that provide technology solutions to the global asset finance and leasing industry as well as provide other services like those offered by NETSOL. To maintain its competitive edge, the company must stay vigilant and adapt to changes in the competitive landscape. This includes monitoring industry trends, investing in research and development, and fostering strategic partnerships to enhance its capabili- ties and market presence.
5. INNOVATION AND R&D
Investment in R&D
Innovation is the driving force behind NET- SOL’s global operations and business growth. Continuing to invest in R&D is essential for staying ahead of technological advancements and developing cutting-edge solutions. The company’s R&D initiatives focus on explor- ing new technologies, enhancing existing products and addressing emerging market needs. By fostering a culture of innovation and supporting its R&D efforts, NETSOL will continue to deliver solutions that lead the industry, address the evolving challenges faced by its clients, and essentially, continue to futureproof their operations.
Collaboration with industry leaders, associa- tions and partners
Collaborating with industry leaders, finance and leasing associations as well as tech- nology partners is a key strategy for driving innovation. These partnerships provide access to new technologies, research insights and collaborative opportunities. By engaging with leading experts and organizations, NETSOL can accelerate its innovation efforts and bring advanced solutions to market more effectively.
IMPACT OF COMPANY BUSINESS ON THE ENVIRNOMENT
Amidst the growing number of climate-relat- ed events worldwide, responsible businesses are increasingly focusing on climate and environmental sustainability. As a software development company rather than a manu- facturing entity, NETSOL’s operations inher- ently have minimal environmental impact. However, as a global player, the company is equally committed to environmental preser-
vation through the adoption of sustainable practices.
Recognizing the challenges posed by global climate change, NETSOL acknowledges its responsibility as a global entity to address this issue. With its borderless operations, the company is determined to leverage all available resources to combat climate change. In pursuit of this goal, NETSOL actively eliminates wasteful practices and optimizes energy efficiency across its processes.
Digitization is central to a paperless organi- zation, and NETSOL’s flagship product, NFS Ascent, along with its digital transformation solutions like NFS Digital and other offerings, empower clients to reduce their reliance on paper. By fostering a paperless ecosystem, these digital solutions contribute to a positive environmental impact. Within NETSOL’s own global operations, paper usage has been significantly reduced, and the company con- tinues to actively pursue further reductions in paper consumption.

ADEQUACY OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS
The Board holds ultimate responsibility for establishing and maintaining robust internal controls over financial reporting. Our inde- pendent internal audit department reports functionally to the Board Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO. Each year, the Board Audit Committee approves the audit plan, which is based on an annual as- sessment of key operating areas. The internal audit department provides recommendations to address any control lapses, which are taken up by the management to remediate control lapses. Observations are shared quarterly with the Board Audit Committee, the CEO, and the relevant divisional management.
The role of the internal audit function contin- ues to evolve in response to events, risks, and regulatory changes impacting the Company, ensuring that its mandate remains aligned

Our internal controls are designed to offer reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Stand- ards (IFRS). However, due to the inherent limitations of any internal control system, management acknowledges that there may be limitations in the effectiveness of these controls, and thus only reasonable assurance can be provided.

At NETSOL, we view diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as cornerstones of our organ- izational culture and success. We understand that a diverse workforce enhances creativity, drives innovation, and leads to better deci- sion-making. Our commitment to leadership diversity is reflected in our women-led departments, where female leaders are empowered to inspire and guide their teams. This commitment goes hand-in-hand with our zero-discrimination policy, which estab- lishes a workplace free from bias, ensuring that every employee is treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background. We have stringent policies in place, such as transport facilities, maternity leaves, sub- sidized sanitary products, anti-harassment regulations and in-house health support, to reinforce a sense of community within our organization.

The following highlights the steps NETSOL Technologies takes as an entity to play its part in achieving the below mentioned goals set by the United Nations.
ENVIRNOMENT AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY •
Solar Energy: Taking a significant step toward renewable energy, Netsol is in the process of installing solar panels. This investment in solar energy not only reduces our reliance on conventional power sources but also demonstrates our dedication to contributing to a more sustainable future.
Data center and server rooms, being large consumers of energy in an IT landscape, have been standardized using an eco-friendly room design that incorporates power and cooling best practices

‘Be Responsible – Save Electricity’ Campaign: Our “Save Electricity” campaign encourages employees to adopt energy-saving habits, such as turning off ACs, computers, and chargers when not in use, and maintaining AC temperatures at 26°C. Through these efforts, we are fostering a culture of responsibility and conservation within our organization.
Maintained Temperature: Maintained a consistent temperature of 26°C across all halls for optimal energy usage.

Focused Work Hours: Implemented a 6 pm to 12 pm ‘One Hall’ work trend to optimize energy consumption by centralizing workspace.
Usage of LED lights: Not only do LED lights create a brighter, more inviting workspace, but they also significantly contribute to our energy efficiency goals. They also use up to 80% less energy compared to traditional lighting.
RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION •
‘Save Food’ Initiative: We are committed to reducing waste and promoting responsible consumption. Our Save Food Initiative encourages employees to be mindful of their food choices, resulting in a remarkable 50% reduction in food consumption.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the board of directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the board of directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Other than the aforementioned standards, interpretations, and amendments, IASB has also issued the following standards, which have yet not been notified locally by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) as at the reporting date:
IFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements
IFRS 19 - IFRS 19 ‘Subsidiaries Without Public Accountability - Disclosures’
IFRS 01 - First Time Adoption of IFRS
IFRS S1 - General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information
IFRS S2 - Climate-Related Disclosures The management believes that adoption of the new standards, amendments and interpretations, which are in issue but not yet effective, is not likely to have any material impact, on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of items in the financial statements for current and future periods and foreseeable future transactions.
3. Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with approved accounting and reporting standards, as applicable in Pakistan, requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The areas involving higher degree of judgement or complexity included in these financial statements are as follows:
Provision for expected credit losses on accounts receivable / contract assets - Note 4.17, 11 & 12
Provision for taxation - Note 4.6
Useful lives and recoverable amounts of depreciable assets - Note 4.1 & 6

4. Material Accounting Policy Information
The Company adopted disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS practice statements 2 ‘Making Ma- teriality Judgments’) from 01 July, 2023.

The amendments require disclo- sure of ‘material’, rather than ‘significant’ accounting policies.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are only effective for accounting periods, beginning

Other than the aforementioned standards, interpretations, and amendments, IASB has also issued the following
standards, which have yet not been notified locally by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan
(SECP) as at the reporting date:
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amounts or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
IFRS 18 - Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

The carrying amount of property and equipment is removed from the statement of financial position upon scrapping or disposal or when no future economic benefit is expected from its use, scrapping or disposal.
IFRS 01 - First Time Adoption of IFRS
IFRS S1 - General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information
Day to day maintenance and normal repairs are charged to profit or loss as and when incurred. Gain or loss on scrapping or disposal of assets, if any, is charged to profit or loss. Gain or loss on disposal of assets is the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset disposed off.

presentation and disclosure of items in the financial statements for current and future periods and foreseeable
The Company recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and identified impairment losses, and adjusted for any re-measurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Company is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are amortized over the useful life of the assets using straight line method at the rates given in note 6.2. Amortization on additions begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Amortization of an asset ceases when the asset is derecognized. Right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment.

3. Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with approved accounting and reporting standards, as applicable in
Pakistan, requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies
and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values
of assets, liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision
(iii) Capital work in progress
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Capital work in progress is stated at cost less any identified impairment losses. It represents expenditure incurred on property and equipment during construction and installation. Cost also includes applicable borrowing costs under IAS 23. These expenditures are transferred to relevant assets’ category as and when assets are available for use.
The areas involving higher degree of judgement or complexity included in these financial statements are as follows:

There are two components of intangible assets:
a. In-house developed intangible assets
b. Intangible assets acquired from market
(a) In-house developed intangible assets
The Company may capitalize certain computer software development costs in accordance with IAS-38 “Intangible Assets”. Costs incurred internally to create a computer software product or to develop an enhancement to an existing product are charged to expense when incurred as research and development expense until technological feasibility for the respective product is established. Thereafter, all software development costs may be capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or recoverable amount. Capitalization will cease when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers.
Amortization is charged on straight line basis over the useful life of the intangible assets. All intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at each reporting date. Rates of amortization are stated in note 7.
(b) Intangible assets acquired from market
Intangible assets acquired from market are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and identified impairment losses, if any.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amounts or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other expenses are charged to profit or loss when they occur.
Amortization is charged by applying straight line method to write off the cost over the remaining useful life of the intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. All intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at each reporting date. Amortization on additions of acquired intangible assets begins when it is available for use i.e. (i.e., the month when the intangible is ready for use) while no amortization is charged for the month in which the asset is disposed off. Rates of amortization are stated in note 6.1.
4.3
Impairment of non financial asset
The Company continually assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If such indication exists, the carrying amounts of such assets are reviewed to assess whether they are recorded in excess of their recoverable amount. Where carrying values exceed the respective recoverable amount, assets are written down to their recoverable amounts and the resulting impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss for the year. The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets’ fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where an impairment loss is recognized, the depreciation charge is adjusted in the future periods to allocate the assets’ revised carrying amount over its estimated useful life.
4.4 Foreign currency translation and transaction
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated in Pak Rupees at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Pak Rupees at the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date when fair values were determined. All exchange differences are charged to statement of profit or loss.
4.5
Staff benefits
(i) Retirement benefits
The Company operates a defined contributory Provident Fund for its permanent employees. Contributions are made equally by the Company and the employee at 8% of basic salary in the Provident Fund on monthly basis. Company’s contribution is recognized as a cost in profit or loss. The fund is administrated by the Trustees.
(ii) Short-term benefits
Short-term benefits to employees are calculated without discounting and are recognized as cost when related services are received.

(iii) Employees’ share option scheme
The Company operates an equity settled share based Employee’ Share Option Scheme (“Scheme”). The fair value of options granted is determined at the grant date and is recognized as employee compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period in profit or loss with corresponding credit to equity as employee compensation reserve. Fair value of options is arrived at using Black Scholes Pricing Model.
There are two components of intangible assets:
a. In-house developed intangible assets
b. Intangible assets acquired from market
When the options are exercised, the proceeds received equivalent to the face value of related shares is credited to share capital and any amount above the share capital is credited to share premium account.

Provision for current tax is based on taxable income for the year determined in accordance with the prevailing laws for taxation of income. The charge for tax on income is calculated at the current rates of taxation as applicable after taking into account tax credit and tax rebates available, if any.

Charge for tax expense also includes adjustments where necessary, relating to prior years which arise from assessments finalized during the current year.
feasibility for the respective product is established. Thereafter, all software development costs may be capitalized
and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or recoverable amount. Capitalization will cease when the product
or enhancement is available for general release to customers.
Amortization is charged on straight line basis over the useful life of the intangible assets. All intangible assets with
an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at each reporting date. Rates of amortization are stated in note 7.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the statement of financial position method in respect of all temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of the taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits can be utilized. Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply to the year when the differences reverse based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of profit or loss, except in the case of items credited or charged to other comprehensive income in which case it is included in other comprehensive income.

Expenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of sales tax, except: - When the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable.
for impairment at each reporting date. Amortization on additions of acquired intangible assets begins when it is
available for use i.e. (i.e., the month when the intangible is ready for use) while no amortization is charged for the
month in which the asset is disposed off. Rates of amortization are stated in note 6.1.
When receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included the net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement of financial position. In accordance with the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, computation of final taxes is not based on taxable income. Therefore, as per IAS 12 Application Guidance on Accounting for Minimum Taxes and Final Taxes issued by the ICAP, these fall within the scope of IFRIC 21 / IAS 37 and accordingly have been classified as levy in these unconsolidated financial statements, except for taxes on dividends on the Company’s investments in subsidiaries and associates which are specifically within the scope of IAS 12 and hence, these continue to be categorised as current income tax.
4.3
Impairment of non financial asset
The Company continually assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be
impaired. If such indication exists, the carrying amounts of such assets are reviewed to assess whether they are
recorded in excess of their recoverable amount. Where carrying values exceed the respective recoverable amount,
assets are written down to their recoverable amounts and the resulting impairment loss is recognized in profit or
loss for the year. The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets’ fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Where an impairment loss is recognized, the depreciation charge is adjusted in the future periods to allocate the
assets’ revised carrying amount over its estimated useful life.

Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. Where outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not probable, a contingent liability is disclosed, unless the possibility of outflow is remote.

4.10 Revenue recognition
The Company follows IFRS 15 for the recognition of revenue from all its revenue streams. The Company determines revenue recognition using the following step wise approach:
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
Determination of the transaction price;
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
Recognition of revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied
The Company records the amount of revenue and related costs by considering whether it is a principal (gross presentation) or an agent (net presentation) by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it typically controls the services before transferring them to the customer. Revenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.
The Company has two primary revenue streams i.e. core revenue or non-core revenue.
Core Revenue:
The Company generates its core revenue from the export of (1) Software Licenses, (2) Services, which include implementation, customization and other consulting services, and (3) Subscription and Support, which includes subscription and post contract support, of its enterprise software solutions for the lease and finance industry. The Company offers its software using both traditional on-premises licensing model and Software as a Service (SaaS) model. The on-premises model involves the sale or license of software on a perpetual basis to customers who take possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware.
Non-Core Revenue:
The Company generates its non-core revenue by providing Business Process Outsourcing (“BPO”) services and other services (including support services to its local customers).
Performance Obligations
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised services to the customer. The Company identifies the performance obligations at contract inception so that the Company can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.
The Company’s contract which contains multiple performance obligations generally consists of the initial sale of licenses and a professional services engagement. Contracts generally have multiple performance obligations as customers purchase maintenance support and services in addition to the licenses. The Company’s single performance obligation arrangements are typically maintenance renewals and professional services engagements.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling price (”SSP”) for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation using its best estimate for the SSP.
Information about the Company’s performance obligations are summarized below:
a) Software licenses:
Performance obligation is satisfied and revenue from software licenses is recognized at the point in time when transfer of control for software is occurred either upon physical delivery of license through CD, USB or electronically using FTP or delivery of the license key by other electronic methods which provide immediate availability of the product to the customer. The Company’s typical payment terms tend to vary by region, but its standard payment terms are within 120 days of invoice.

The Company follows IFRS 15 for the recognition of revenue from all its revenue streams. The Company determines
Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the product is made available to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 12 to 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 120 days of invoice. Performance obligation against support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. The Company’s customers purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their support services contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 120 days of invoice.

Performance obligation is satisfied and revenue from professional services is recognized over the time and typically comprises implementation, development, customization, enhancements, data migration, training or other consulting services. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation to data migration and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes revenue from time-and-material arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as measured by efforts incurred to date, compared to total estimated efforts to complete the services project. The management applies judgment while estimating efforts to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones as agreed in the contract and payments are typically due in 120 days after invoice.

Contract modifications involving changes in scope or price are treated as separate contracts if they add distinct performance obligations at standalone prices. If not, they are either treated as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new one or, if no new distinct obligations arise, adjustments are made on a cumulative catch-up basis i.e. recognizing in the current period the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods according to the revised performance obligations.
performance obligation arrangements are typically maintenance renewals and professional services engagements.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling
price (”SSP”) for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract’s transaction
price to each performance obligation using its best estimate for the SSP.
Significant Judgments
Information about the Company’s performance obligations are summarized below:
Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under IFRS 15 for the Company’s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.
a) Software licenses:
Performance obligation is satisfied and revenue from software licenses is recognized at the point in time when
Judgment is required to determine the stand alone selling price (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation. The Company rarely licenses or sells products on a stand-alone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because the Company does not sell the license, product or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes various factors, including its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers.

Notes to and forming part of the Financial Statements
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
The stand-alone selling price of the licenses was measured primarily through an analysis of pricing that management evaluated when quoting prices to customers. Although the Company has no history of selling its software separately from support and other services, the Company does have historical experience with amending contracts with customers to provide additional modules of its software or providing those modules at an optional price. This information guides the Company in assessing the stand-alone selling price of the Company’s software, since the Company can observe instances where a customer had a particular component of the Company’s software that was essentially priced separate from other goods and services that the Company delivered to that customer.
The Company recognises revenue from implementation and customization services using percentage of estimated man-days that the work requires. The Company believes the level of effort to complete the services is best measured by the amount of time (measured as an employee working for one day on implementation/customization work) that is required to complete the implementation or customization work. The Company continuously reviews its estimate of man-days required to complete implementation and customization services.
Revenue is recognized over time for the Company’s subscription, support and fixed fee professional services that are separate performance obligations. For the Company’s professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using man-days expended to measure progress. Judgement is required in estimating project status and efforts necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including man-day rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.
If a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. The Company exercises significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single arrangement. The Company’s judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.
If a contract includes variable consideration, the Company exercises judgment in estimating the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. When estimating variable consideration, the Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Variable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price only when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.
Practical Expedients and Exemptions
There are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under IFRS 15 that impact timing of revenue recognition and the Company’s disclosures. Below is a list of practical expedients the Company applied in the adoption and application of IFRS 15:
a) The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected
within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.
b) The Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the statement of profit or loss.
c) The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts that have an
original expected duration of one year or less.
d) The Group does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the Group recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements).
4.11 Costs to obtain a contract
The Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any reporting date. In general, the Company incurs few direct incremental costs for obtaining new customer contracts. We rarely incur incremental costs to review or otherwise enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, our sales personnel receive fees that we refer to as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new customers. Our sales personnel are required to perform additional duties beyond signing of new deals, including account management of customers and cash collection efforts.

Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Company performs under the contract.
Revenue is recognized over time for the Company’s subscription, support and fixed fee professional services that
are separate performance obligations. For the Company’s professional services, revenue is recognized over time,
generally using man-days expended to measure progress. Judgement is required in estimating project status
and efforts necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates,
including man-day rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.

Impairment of financial assets
The Company recognizes an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.
ECLs are recognized in two stages. For credit exposures, for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Company applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment, based on the groupings for various customers segments that have similar patterns (i.e. by geography and customer wise).
(ii) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in IFRS 9 are satisfied. The Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and borrowings
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognized in the unconsolidated statement of profit or loss when liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Other financial liabilities are also subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Any gain or loss on de- recognition is also recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability. Difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

Investment in subsidiary is initially recognized at cost. At subsequent reporting date, recoverable amounts are estimated to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any, and carrying amount of investment is adjusted accordingly. Impairment losses are recognized as expense in the statement of profit or loss.

significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over
the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).
An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Company applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore,
the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognizes a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs

experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment, based on
the groupings for various customers segments that have similar patterns (i.e. by geography and customer wise).
Under the equity method, investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognize changes in the Company’s share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.
(ii) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss,
loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as
appropriate.
The statement of profit or loss reflects the Company’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Any change in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Company’s other comprehensive income. In addition, when there has been a change recognized directly in the equity of the associate, the Company recognizes its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity.
All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net
of directly attributable transaction costs.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, unless otherwise stated. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the group.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial
liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Gains or losses on liabilities held
for trading are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition
The Company periodically determines whether it is necessary to recognize any impairment loss on its investment in its associate or not. The Company determines on annual basis whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Company calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, and then recognizes the loss within ‘Share of profit or loss of an associate’ in the statement of profit or loss.

the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognized in the unconsolidated statement of profit
or loss when liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process.
Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that
are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.
5. Summary Of Other Accounting Policies
This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
5.1 Lease liabilities
Other financial liabilities are also subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Interest expense
At the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in- substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

recognition is also recognized in the statement of profit or loss.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms,
In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.
or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as
derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability. Difference in the respective carrying amounts
is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Company applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Significant judgement in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal & termination options
The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.
The Company applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew or to terminate the lease. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal & termination. After the commencement date, the Company reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy).
5.2 Advances and deposits
These are recognized at nominal amount which is fair value of considerations to be received in future.
5.3 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction /acquisition of qualifying assets are capitalized up to the date, including the period when technical and administrative work is carried on; the respective assets are available for the intended use. All other mark-up, interest and other related charges are taken to the statement of profit or loss currently. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use.
5.4 Dividend and appropriation to reserves
Dividend and appropriation to reserves are recognized in the financial statements in the period in which these are approved. However, if they are approved after the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorized for issue they are disclosed in the notes to financial statements.
5.5 Fair value
The fair value of financial instruments that are actively traded in organized financial markets is determined by reference to quoted market bid prices at the close of business on the statement of financial position date. Where there is no active market, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. Such techniques include using recent arm’s length market transaction; reference to the current market value of another instrument, which has substantially similar characteristics, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.
5.6 Earnings per share
The Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS). Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary share holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
Description of scheme
As per the approved employee stock option scheme, the Board and the compensation committee granted three million stock op- tions to employees on December 27, 2021 at a grant price of Rs. 77.84 per option. No amount is paid or payable by any employee on receipt of the option. No option carries the right to vote or dividend. According to the scheme, 50% of the options will become exercisable after completion of 12 months from date of grant, another 30% of the granted option after completion of 24 months from the grant date and the remaining 20% of the granted option will become exercisable after completion of 36 months from the date of grant. The options are exercisable within a period of 10 years with un-exercised options to lapse on December 27, 2031.
Measurement of fair value
The Company uses “Black Scholes Pricing Model” to determine the fair value of options at the grant date. Fair value at grant date of the equity settled share based arrangement was calculated using the following assumptions.

28. Contingencies and Commitments
For the Year Ended June 30, 2024
28.1 Contingencies
Mr. Ahsan Zubair, an ex-employee of the Company has filed a case for recovery of damages dated January 26, 2013 for malicious prosecution before the Honourable Civil Court, Lahore and has sought damages to the tune of Rs. 500 million. The case was filed five years after a complaint lodged by NetSol Technologies Limited with Federal Investigation Authority pertaining to use of NetSol’s IP without authority by a company formed by the employee and his partner who was also an ex-employee of the Company. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of evidence of the plaintiff and the laws applicable, it can safely be inferred that, on merits, no case for damages is made out. This is also endorsed by the fact that the case is barred by the laws relating to limitation. Moreover none of the ingredients forming basis for allowing a case of malicious prosecution are attracted. In the opinion of the legal advisor, the outcome of the case is expected in favour of the Company, hence, no provision is incorporated in these financial statements.
24.1 Creditors include Rs. 1.08 million (2023: Rs. 1 million) payable to a related party HospitAll (Private) Limited against provision
of medical services.
24.2 This represents amount due to a related party, OTOZ Inc, in the normal course of business.

41. Capital Risk Management
The Company’s objective when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefit for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares.
The management seeks to maintain a balance between higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The Company finances its operations through equity, borrowings and management of working capital with a view to maintain an appropriate mix between various sources of finance to minimize risk.
In line with the norms, the Company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including current and non current) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the statement of financial position plus net debt. As at the reporting date, the gearing ratio of the Company was worked out as under:

cost efficient funding as well as to manage financial risk to minimize earnings volatility and provide maximum return
to shareholders.
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Majority of the interest rate exposure arises from bank borrowings, lease liabilities, term deposits, deposits in profit and loss/saving accounts with banks and investments in mutual funds. The Company mitigates its interest rate risk by investing available cash in mutual funds and bank deposits, generating more return compared to the finance cost.
The Board of Directors of the Company has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s
risk management process. The management continually monitors the Company’s risk management process to ensure
that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management processes are reviewed regularly to

The Company has no instruments subject to fixed interest rate.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
As at June 30, 2024, if floating interest rates had been 1% higher / lower with all other variables held constant, profit before tax for the year would have been lower / higher by Rs. 7.74 million (2023: Rs. 3.75 million), mainly as a result of interest exposure on variable rate borrowings.
(iii) Other price risk
Other price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from currency risk or interest rate risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded in the market. The Company is not exposed to significant other price risk.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. Credit risk of the Company arises from trade debts, loans and advances, trade deposits, other receivables and deposits with banks. To reduce exposure to credit risk, the Company has developed a formal approval process. The management assesses the credit quality of the customers, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors and makes provision against those balances (if required). The utilization of credit limits is regularly monitored. For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a strong credit rating are accepted.
The Company monitors the credit quality of its financial assets with reference to historical performance of such assets and available external credit ratings, if any. As at June 30, 2024, the maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the financial assets as detailed below:

The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual customer. At June 30, the Company had 31 customers owing Rs. 5.58 billion. The Company has made allowances, where necessary, for potential losses on credits extended.
For trade receivables and contract assets, the Company uses a simplified approach to calculate expected credit losses (ECLs). A provision matrix has been established based on the Company’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. This matrix is based on the segments that exhibit similar patterns, such as geography and customer type.
The management estimates the recoverability of trade receivables on the basis of financial position and past history of its customers based on the objective evidence that it may not receive the amount due from the particular customer. The provision is written off by the Company when it expects that it cannot recover the balance due. Any subsequent repayments in relation to amounts written off are credited directly to profit or loss.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. The Company follows an effective cash management and planning process to ensure availability of funds and to take appropriate actions for new requirements. The Company’s liquidity management involves projecting cash flows and considering the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these, monitoring balance sheet liquidity ratios against internal and external regulatory requirements and maintaining debt financing plans. The table below analyses the Company’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the reporting date to contractual maturity dates.

The contractual cash flows relating to the above financial liabilities have been determined on the basis of mark-up rate effective as at June 30. Rates of interest / mark - up and their maturities are given in the respective notes.
(d) Fair value of financial instruments
Fair value is an amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. Consequently, differences may arise between the carrying value and the fair value estimates.
Fair value is determined on the basis of objective evidence at each reporting date. The management assessed that the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
